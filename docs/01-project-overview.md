## Project Overview

CloudCart Technologies is a mid-sized B2B SaaS company that provides e-commerce cart and payment integration services to online retailers.

The organization processes customer PII, transaction metadata, and business operational data. As the company scales and onboard enterprise clients, a structured cybersecurity risk management program aligned with the NIST cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is required.

This project demonstrates a practical NIST CSF implementation focused on identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks in a cloud-native SaaS environment.
